<h1>The PATH Pledge</h1>
<p>"Join OFTEN UPDATED NUMBER people who have taken the PATH pledge for a better ride"</p>

<p>I am a PATH rider who wants a better experience. I pledge to do the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Stand to the <em>side</em> of the door to <em>let all people off</em> before boarding</li>
    <li><em>Move in</em> to the center of the train to make space for others to board</li>
</ol>
